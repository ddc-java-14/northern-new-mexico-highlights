## Summary
    This app will show you what places to visit and what to see when visiting a certain city or surrounding area, in Northern New Mexico.
The surrounding 'highlights' of that city will appear. 'Highlights' being points of interest, historical markers, churches,
or even just a great restaurant! The user will be able to find some of the most interesting and highly recommended
places to visit and see in the great wilderness and cities of northern New Mexico! 

My app will use input from the user and turn it into pictures of places to see, as well as a description of the places as well.


## Intended users

*Users will be an out of state visitor, visiting northern New Mexico and wanting some good advice as where to go. 
* Northern New Mexico people needing a place to go where they have never been. 
>Out-of-state visitors likely have never been here, and are in need of a little good advice on where to go! 

>Many local people have never been as far as 2 hours away from their home in there entire life!


## Client component

### Functionality

>The person using this app will be able to type in the city , or surrounding area and be able to see some cool places in that area!

The local content will consist of four different places of interest local to that area. 
    
### Device/external services

On the city entered , it could also pop up a  link to click on. It would be using a web service that is specific to northern New Mexico.

## Server component
The internet would provide pictures and information on the place by the person wanting to go.


### Functionality
The internet would provide information on the link provided.

### Persistent data

List the content that will be stored on the server side. This should include any information that a user of your system should expect to be accessible across multiple sessions of use, even if accessed from separate devices. In addition, if there will be data originating from some users that will then be accessible by other users, it should be part of the persistent data on the server. 
    
### External services

If the server component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. stock prices, Open Movie Database), those should also be listed here. Any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.
    
## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
