## Summary
    This app will show you what places to visit and what to see when visiting a certain city or surrounding area, in Northern New Mexico.
The surrounding 'highlights' of that city will appear. 'Highlights' being points of interest, historical markers, churches,
or even just a great restaurant! The user will be able to find some of the most interesting and highly recommended
places to visit and see in the great wilderness and cities of northern New Mexico!

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
